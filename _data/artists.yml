- name: "Eung Ho Park"
  artist: "Eung Ho Park"
  bio: "I select ordinary objects used in routine daily consumption, and contemplate how I can transform them to comment on current social issues or reflect on existential concerns. These manufactured goods, like items in a time capsule, represent and preserve ideas of culture. Much of my current work is large scale, using multiples, sometimes hundreds and thousands of objects, arranged in given spaces. I transform groupings of mundane objects, whether spoons, bottle caps, recycled plastic soda bottles, caution tapes or bowling balls, into installations that depict contemporary narratives of humanity."
