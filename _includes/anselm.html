<p>I regret knowing what time it’s ever been, I regret <br>not painting Not The Bathroom on your white <br>walls in big indigo letters, I regret the feint <br>of leaning in in that death by snake landscape <br>that was collage, I regret all kinds of nothings <br>little beautiful timidities I don’t long-view regret <br>it was a they, we added up, you have to give people<br> the space you didn’t know how to take, you don’t <br>you’re a sorting mechanism, you’re not actually <br>all slime, you’re a very fierce frail piece of guy <br>supposedly you didn’t turn around the last time <br>dad said goodbye, who needs to notice, you being<br> yourself don’t quite work your shit out loud<br>enough for the novelistic everyfucks, sunny<br>helmet kiss on forearm, light repulsion, at deep<br>night I come all over the courtly pre-imagined <br>my interest in desperation lies only in that<br> sometimes I find myself having become<br>desperate, I know ghosts, they’re being ordered<br> about, fucked as ever by limitation, a book<br> the size of your fingers told me to force it so <br>so I say a damned thing, with love crushed to<br> bring out flavor, your look at me way keeps feeling<br> space filled with massive non-participation, then<br> bodies force you to appear to measure out the<br> exacting space to not die in, or be non-dead already</p>
