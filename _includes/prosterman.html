<p>Northern lights verglazed the moon:</p><p>Snow cones</p><p>that were veins of frost lace over</p><p>past nights that never happened</p><p>yet</p><p>cardinal hugely puffed up for winter hopping around in my garden contentedly <br>searching for kernels to get her through the winter or through the long flight</p><p>anyway,</p><p>low to the ground and enjoying what is there.</p><p>A giant star died in a supernova.</p><p>This is my rime, my film, my repeated snapshot,</p><p>my repeated image of you.</p>
